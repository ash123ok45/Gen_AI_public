Q1.  You are designing a prompt for a RAG system to answer customer queries using company documents. What is the main purpose of the Corrective RAG Template? 
a) To store documents in a database 
b) To validate and refine retrieved information 
c) To generate random responses 
d) To design a user interface 
Correct Answer: b 

Explanation: The Corrective RAG Template validates and refines retrieved data to ensure accurate and relevant responses, improving the reliability of a RAG system for customer queries.

Q2. What problem does a Corrective RAG template primarily try to solve in production assistants?
    a) High GPU costs
    b) Slow token streaming
    c) Hallucinations caused by unsupported claims
    d) Lack of user interface themes
Correct Answer: c
Explanation: Corrective RAG focuses on catching and fixing hallucinations by grounding answers in verified context.

Q3. A developer needs to integrate voice capabilities into a RAG Voice Assistant. Which tool is essential?  
a) Speechtotext model  
b) Vector Store  
c) Fallback Mechanism  
d) Web Search  
Correct Answer: a  
Explanation: SpeechRecognition converts audio input into text for processing

Q4. Your RAG chatbot fails to find relevant data for a user query. What does the Fallback Mechanism do in this situation? 
a) It restarts the chatbot
b) It provides a default or alternative response
c) It trains a new model 
d) It deletes the query 
Correct Answer: b 
Explanation: The Fallback Mechanism in RAG provides a default or alternative response when relevant data is not found, ensuring the system remains functional and user-friendly.

Q5. Your team needs to enhance a RAG system by including recent online data. What is the role of Web Search in this context?
a) To fetch up-to-date information from the internet
b) To store data locally 
c) To train the language model 
d) To create a web interface
 Correct Answer: a 
Explanation: Web Search in RAG systems retrieves current information from the internet to supplement internal data, ensuring responses are relevant and up-to-date.

Q6. (Select two): Your travel‑booking bot uses a **fallback mechanism**. In which two situations should the bot automatically call a fallback model?  
    a) The retriever returns an empty list  
    b) The primary LLM API returns HTTP 429 (rate limit)  
    c) The user says “thank you”  
    d) The vector dimension is 1 536  
Correct Answer: a, b  
Explanation: Empty retrieval means no knowledge; rate limiting means the main model is temporarily unavailable—both justify falling back.

Q7. A developer chains GPT‑4(strong model) → GPT‑3.5 → Rule‑based FAQ in descending order of capability until one responds successfully. What design pattern is this?
    a) Round‑robin sampling
    b) Cascading fallback
    c) Self‑RAG loop
    d) Prompt chaining
Correct Answer: b
Explanation: A cascade tries stronger options first and falls back to simpler ones.

Q8. Your compliance bot answers queries about RBI circulars. When should it most likely call **web search** inside RAG?
    a) When the circular reference date is newer than the model’s knowledge cut‑off  
    b) When the user’s language is Hindi  
    c) When embeddings length exceed 1 024  
    d) On every single user query by default  
Correct Answer: a  
Explanation: Web search is ideal for post‑cut‑off or very recent information.

Q9. (Select two): In **Adaptive RAG**, which two signals are commonly used to decide whether to fetch *more* documents?  
    a) The length of the user query in tokens  
    b) The similarity score of the top‑1 document  
    c) The current server’s CPU temperature  
    d) The day of the week  
Correct Answer: a, b  
Explanation: Longer queries or low similarity confidence often trigger a wider retrieval.

Q10. You’re building a **RAG Chat Assistant** for an internal IT help‑desk. To store embeddings on a single machine with fast similarity search, you choose  
    a) CSV files  
    b) FAISS index  
    c) MongoDB without vectors  
    d) Google Sheets  
Correct Answer: b  
Explanation: FAISS provides efficient in‑memory vector search ideal for prototyping.

Q11. What is the primary goal of a RAG Voice Assistant? 
a) To edit audio files 
b) To answer spoken queries using external data 
c) To store voice recordings 
d) To design a user interface 
Correct Answer: b 
Explanation: A RAG Voice Assistant uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to answer spoken queries by retrieving relevant external data, enhancing response accuracy.

Q12. (SELECT TWO) While designing a **RAG Voice Assistant**, which two components are mandatory apart from the LLM?  
    a) Speech‑to‑Text engine (e.g., Whisper)  
    b) TTS engine (e.g., Coqui‑TTS)  
    c) Power‑point generator  
    d) Image captioner  
Correct Answer: a, b  
Explanation: Voice assistants need STT to capture queries and TTS to speak responses.

Q13.Which components are critical for Text Summarization in LangChain?  
a) Text Splitter  
b) Embeddings  
c) Both a and b  
d) None of the above  
Correct Answer: c  
Explanation: Text Splitters divide content, and Embeddings enable semantic analysis. 

Q14. Which are benefits of using LangGraph in chatbots? (Select two)  
a) State management  
b) Workflow orchestration  
c) Real-time translation  
d) Built-in vector stores  
Correct Answer: a, b  
Explanation: LangGraph manages conversation states and workflows but lacks translation or vector stores by default.

a) Transcribing video audio to text 
b) Editing video visuals 
c) Storing video files 
d) Designing a website 
Correct Answer: a 
Explanation: A YouTube Video Summarizer uses LangChain to transcribe video audio into text, which is then summarized using retrieval and generation.

Q16. An open‑source toolkit widely used for on‑device speech‑to‑text in voice assistants is ___.
    a) Whisper  
    b) Selenium  
    c) Pandas

    c) Increase max tokens to 4 000  
    d) Remove system prompt altogether  
Correct Answer: b  
Explanation: Explicit constraints steer the model away from fictional packages.

Q18. For a **Text Summarisation** tool, users can choose “bullet” or “paragraph” mode. What is the *simplest* prompt technique to support both?  
    a) Two separate LLM calls with hard‑coded templates  
    b) A single template with a `{style}` placeholder swapped at runtime  
    c) Randomly alternate styles every run  
    d) Ask users to manually edit the summary  
Correct Answer: b  
Explanation: Parameterised prompts keep code concise while offering style options.
